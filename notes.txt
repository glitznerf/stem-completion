Differences in testing implemented stemmer against NLTK Porter stemmer.
Out of testset with 209 words, 23 were not matching:
Word: they, generated: thei, true: they!
Word: usually, generated: usu, true: usual!
Word: judgements, generated: judg, true: judgement!
Word: is, generated: i, true: is!
Word: matter, generated: matt, true: matter!
Word: something, generated: somet, true: someth!

Word: father, generated: fath, true: father!
Word: suggested, generated: sugges, true: suggest!
Word: decencies, generated: dec, true: decenc!
Word: is, generated: i, true: is!
23 wrong out of 209

for reproducability, we will continue with generally accepted nltk stemmer implementation.
