## Description
Stemming is natural language processing technique, applied for example in information retrieval, text compression and text similarity measuring. The output of a stemming algorithm, however, is not trivially invertible. This leads to the Stem Completion Problem, which is the computational reconstruction of the original words given a vector of stems. This project aims to study the Porter Stemmer applied to English language texts and the corresponding stemming statistics and to design algorithms and solutions to the Stem Completion Problem by discussing a variety of methods of both traditional and machine learning methods.
